## Technology Stack

- **Frontend**: React 19 with Vite
- **Routing**: React Router DOM
- **Styling**: CSS Modules
- **Icons**: Lucide React
- **State Management**: React Context API
- **APIs**: OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo, Qloo Restaurant API
- **HTTP Client**: Axios

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Set up environment variables**:
   Create a `.env` file in the root directory with your API keys:
   ```bash
   # API Keys
   VITE_OPENAI_API_KEY=your_openai_api_key_here
   VITE_QLOO_API_KEY=your_qloo_api_key_here
   ```

3. **Start development server**:
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

4. **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://localhost:5173`

## How It Works

1. **Create/Join Room**: Users can create a new dining room or join an existing one with a PIN
2. **Add Preferences**: Each diner enters their name, mood, cuisine preferences, budget, and travel distance
3. **Lobby**: View all diners and their preferences in real-time
4. **AI Summary**: GPT analyzes group preferences and provides personalized insights
5. **Recommendations**: Get restaurant suggestions from Qloo API based on group preferences
6. **Voting**: Vote on favorite restaurants and see results
7. **Chat with AI**: Ask follow-up questions or request different suggestions

## Key Components
